## GYMLOG-CLIENT

This is an simple user interface for [gymlog-api](https://github.com/villevaltonen/gymlog-api). The client application is built with React.

### Run the application

1. Ensure backend and database are up and running
2. Execute following line:

```bash
npm run start
```

### TODO

- Edit set (not needed necessarily)
  - Select a set from list and store id in a hook
  - When a set is selected, convert add set button to edit set and use different API
- Tests
- Improve styling
- useReducer for providers (?)
- Cleaning up
